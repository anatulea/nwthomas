# Hey, what's happening?

I'm Nathan, but a lot of people just call me Nate.

Here's a little about what I'm currently up to:

- 🔥 I work as a software engineer at [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
- 🦙 Pronouns: [He/Him/His/Himself](https://pronoun.is/he)
- 🧙🏻‍♂️ I'm currently self-studying data science and machine learning.
- 📓 I write a _ton_ at the following places:
  - [Dev.to](https://dev.to/nwthomas)
  - [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/nwthomas)
  - [Medium](https://medium.com/@nwthomas)
- 🏗 I'm building a new app. It's at [bandolier.app](https://bandolier.app/), but it's just a logo page at the moment. It's a secret, so don't tell anyone. 🤫
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I'm looking for advice on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

My hobbies include random stuff like running 🏃🏻‍♂️, yoga 🧘🏻‍♂️, audio engineering 👨🏻‍🎤, reading 📚, games 🎮🎲, and coffee ☕️.

If you want to contact me, the best way is either through a [Twitter](https://twitter.com) DM or on the contact form through my [personal portfolio site](https://nathanthomas.dev/).
